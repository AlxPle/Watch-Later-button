# Privacy Policy for Watch Later button

**Last Updated: October 8, 2024**

## Introduction

Welcome to the Watch Later button extension for YouTube™. This extension is designed to provide a simple and efficient way to add videos to your "Watch Later" playlist on YouTube. Your privacy is important to us, and this policy is intended to help you understand what information we handle.

## Data Collection and Usage

We are committed to protecting your privacy. The Watch Later button extension **does not collect, store, share, or transmit any of your personal data.**

The extension's functionality is limited to interacting with the content on the YouTube page you are viewing. It adds a "Save to Watch Later" button and, when clicked, communicates directly with YouTube's services to add or remove a video from your "Watch Later" playlist. All actions are performed locally in your browser, and no information about your activity is sent to our servers or any third parties.

## Permissions

To function correctly, the Watch Later button extension requires permission to access content on `https://www.youtube.com/*`. This permission is used exclusively for the following purposes:

*   To identify the video you are watching.
*   To add the "Save to Watch Later" button to the YouTube page.
*   To send the "add" or "remove" action to YouTube's services when you click the button.

We do not use this permission to track your browsing history or collect any other information.

## Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy in the future if the extension's functionality changes. If we make any material changes, we will notify you by updating the "Last Updated" date of this policy and, if required, by providing a more prominent notice within the extension or on its Chrome Web Store page.

## Contact Us

If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, please feel free to contact us.
